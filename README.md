# Talking Dog Furhat Skill
Based off of the OpenAI template skill provided by Furhat, adapted
to speak as though it were a dog who can speak English. Also, 
some of the gestures from Furhat's example dog skill have been
repurposed here, and interspersed with the speech.
For this to work, you will need to add your own API key to:
src/main/kotlin/furhatos/app/talkingdog/flow/chatbot/openai.kt
